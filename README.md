A proof-of-concept Angular application demonstrating runtime switching between multiple map libraries with support for raster layers, GeoJSON, and 3D capabilities.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**This is a demonstration project only.** The data and layers shown in this POC are for testing and visualization purposes and should **not be used for any production, research, or decision-making purposes.**

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
